### Hello there!

My name is Cobe Lawson, and I'm an aspiring software developer. I have been studying programming on/off for years now and have recently graduated from the Promineo Tech Back-End Software Development bootcamp through my local university Northwest Arkansas Community College (NWACC). I have experience working with Python, Java, C++, Javascript, SQL, as well as networking and many other subjects. 

Ever since I was a boy, I have been obsessed with technology, computers, games, hardware. I built my own desktop when I graduated high school and I still use it today, nearly ten years later (though with a few upgrades along the way). In addition to that I have a passion for books, movies, stories, music, art, and so much more!


- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge of more programming languages and systems such as React and refamiliarizing myself with JavaScript
